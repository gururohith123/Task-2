### Overview of the project :
### Project: Student Grade Tracker
### Objective:
Develop a Java application to streamline student grade management. This application should enable:
 * Effortless Data Entry: Capture and store student details (names, IDs) and their grades across subjects/assessments.
 * Precise Grade Calculations: Accurately compute grades, including averages, weighted averages, and GPAs.
 * Comprehensive Reporting: Generate reports such as individual student reports, class summaries, and honor rolls.
 * Data-Driven Insights: Provide basic analysis to identify trends, areas for improvement, and potential academic concerns.
### Key Activities:
 * Data Model Design: Create a well-structured data model (using classes/objects) to represent student information and grades.
 * User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive interface for:
   * Data entry and editing.
   * Grade calculation and reporting.
   * Data visualization and analysis.
 * Data Management: Implement efficient data storage and retrieval (e.g., using databases or files).
 * Calculation & Reporting Logic: Develop algorithms for accurate grade calculations and generate reports in various formats.
 * Robust Error Handling: Ensure data integrity by incorporating robust error handling and input validation.
### Technology Stack:
 * Primary Language: Java
 * Data Structures: Utilize appropriate data structures (arrays, lists, maps) for efficient data management.
 * Optional: Consider using a database (SQLite, MySQL) for advanced data management.
